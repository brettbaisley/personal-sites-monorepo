        <p class="mt-8">One of my proudest photography moments was having my photo of Ritchie Wharf prominently featured in WestJet Magazine, 
            the airlineâ€™s inflight publication. Showcased at the center of the page, my image captured the charm of this 
            iconic Miramichi destination, highlighted in an article on must-visit spots in the area. Seeing my work published 
            and inspiring travelers to explore new places was an incredible honor!</p>
