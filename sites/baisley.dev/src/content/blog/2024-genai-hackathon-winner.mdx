I'm thrilled to share that my team and I won the **People's Choice Award** at the **2024 Morgan Stanley Generative AI Hackathon** — an incredible event that brought together some of the brightest minds across the firm to explore how AI can transform the way we work.

Our winning project tackled a challenge that every production support engineer knows too well:  
When an alert fires, finding the correct **resolution steps** can take precious minutes — sometimes longer — as operators dig through documentation, wikis, and past incident notes.



## Our Idea: AI-Powered Alert Resolution at Your Fingertips

We built an application that **automatically pulls alert details**, uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to look up the relevant resolution steps from internal documentation, and then **embeds those instructions directly into the alert**.

No more manual searches.  
No more context switching.  
Just actionable steps — instantly.

This means that when an alert appears, the operator already has the **exact instructions they need to troubleshoot and recover** — saving time, reducing errors, and improving overall reliability.



## Four Rounds of Judging - and a Big Win

The hackathon had **four rounds of judging**, with projects evaluated on innovation, technical execution, and impact. Our solution stood out not only for its technical implementation, but also for the **tangible value** it delivered to production support teams.

We were honored to present our project to **senior-level executives**, who saw the potential for this technology to streamline workflows across the organization.

When voting opened for the **People's Choice Award**, our project resonated with the audience — and we took home the win!



## Under the Hood - How It Works

Our solution combined:

- **Generative AI** for natural language understanding and contextual responses  
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** to ensure answers were grounded in accurate, up-to-date documentation  
- **Automated alert enrichment**, embedding the AI-generated resolution steps directly into the alert system  

The result? A **self-service resolution assistant** for operators — like having a subject matter expert available 24/7.



## Why This Matters

This project demonstrated not only how **Generative AI** can accelerate problem-solving, but also how **practical AI applications** can directly improve operational resilience. For production support engineers, every minute counts - and our solution helps reclaim those minutes.



## Looking Ahead

The hackathon win was a huge honor, but for me, it's also a testament to the potential of **AI-driven automation** in enterprise environments. I'm excited to continue exploring ways to combine AI, automation, and engineering best practices to make systems smarter, faster, and more reliable.
